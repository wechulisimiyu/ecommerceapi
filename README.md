# ecommerceapi

## Introduction

ecommerce API is the backbone of an ecommerce site I hope to build with a react front-end to ease purchases of products offered by various vendors in my small community.

## Project Support Features

* Users can signup and login to their accounts.
* Public (non-authenticated) users can access all products on the platform, and add then up on an order, to their cart.
* Public users will need to be authenticated to complete their order.
* Authenticated users can access all products as well as edit their profile.

## Installation Guide

* Clone this repository [here](https://github.com/wechu07/ecommerceapi.git).
* The master branch is the most stable branch at any given time, ensure you're working from it.
* Run npm install to install all dependencies
* Create an config/config.env file in your project root folder and add your variables. See sample.env for assistance.
* You can either work with the local MongoDB configuration,or the [cloud](https://cloud.mongodb.com/) option. Configure it and save the URI in the config/config.env file.

## Usage

* Run `npm run dev` to start the application.
* Connect to the API using Postman (or Hoppscotch, Thunderclient etc) on port 5000.
